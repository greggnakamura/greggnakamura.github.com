Hey there! I'm Gregg Nakamura, Web Developer, currently working for [Wakefly, Inc.](http://www.wakefly.com/), based out of Westborough, MA.

Originally in-house for the first few years, I'm now a 100% remote Wakefly employee, with my home base situated in Northern California.   

Born and raised in Southern California (San Fernando Valley), I decided to persue my Development goals while in living in Long Beach, CA, completed my degree while in Brooklyn, NY, and started my professional career in Westborough, MA in 2008.   

While I favor Front-end development, my duties primarily involve ASP.NET development, custom or CMS based.  My position allows me to wear quite a few hats, so needless to say, it's been and continues to be, an amazing professional experience. 


### Don't judge me!
When I'm not hanging out with Sublime Text, I'm usually watching auto racing of some sort.  Yes, auto racing, specifically, [Formula 1](http://www.formula1.com/) ([Ferrari](http://formula1.ferrari.com/)), [IndyCar](http://www.indycar.com/), [Tudor United SportsCar](http://www.imsa.com/), & the [Pirelli World Challenge](http://www.world-challenge.com/). I always love talking racing!
