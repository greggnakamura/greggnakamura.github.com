Currently work remotely as a Web Developer for a Boston based marketing firm ([Wakefly, Inc.](http://www.wakefly.com/)), living in sunny Los Angeles, CA. As a small company, we are tasked with everything in between from design to web development to building marketing based solutions. My day might include CMS development, responsive design and development work, building and testing email templates, or implementing digital marketing solutions.

### When I'm not coding...
When I'm not Sublime Texting things, you can find me at a local racing event or at an F1 MeetUp. This bug hit me back in '93 after I attended my first event, the Long Beach Grand Prix, and I've been hooked ever since. Religiously, I follow:
