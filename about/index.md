Currently work remotely for a Boston based marketing firm ([Wakefly, Inc.](http://www.wakefly.com/)), living in sunny Los Angeles, CA. As a small company, we are tasked with everything in between from design to web development to building marketing based solutions. I am an Full Stack, Front-End focused, Developer.

In my spare time I participate in coding challenges ([CodeEval](https://www.codeeval.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)), [take training courses](http://www.pluralsight.com/), and attend developer related [MeetUps](http://www.meetup.com/find/events/?allMeetups=false&keywords=web+development&radius=50&userFreeform=Los+Angeles%2C+CA&mcId=z90001&mcName=Los+Angeles%2C+CA&eventFilter=mysugg). I also try to keep up with things on a daily basis, tagging interesting topics on my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/greggnakamura/favorites).

### When I'm not coding...
When I'm not Sublime Texting things, you can find me at the local race track or at an F1 MeetUp. My second love is auto racing. This bug hit me back in '93 when I attended my first event, the Long Beach Grand Prix and I've been hooked ever since. Religiously, I follow:

* [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/)
* Sports Car Racing
    * [WEC](http://www.fiawec.com/)
    * [TUDOR United SportsCar](http://www.imsa.com/series/united-sportscar)
    * [Continental Tire](http://www.imsa.com/series/sportscar-challenge)
