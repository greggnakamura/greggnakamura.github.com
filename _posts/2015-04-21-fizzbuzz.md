**Below are my FizzBuzz solutions successfully submitted to both [CodeEval](https://www.codeeval.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) challenges.**

HackerRank's challenge was to write the shortest code as possible. Max score is 20. I received a score of **0.2** for the `fizzbuzz.js` solution and **0.4** for the `fizzbuzz-shortest.js` solution.

**HackerRank submission (Golf)**

Obviously I need to think about this a little more. Definitely will take any suggestions if anyone is willing to provide some insight on how I can improve on my code.
