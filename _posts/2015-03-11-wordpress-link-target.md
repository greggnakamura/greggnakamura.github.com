Might just be me, but at first glance, I didn't quite know how to set a Menu item in WordPress to open in a new window/tab.

It's not available by default as far as I can tell, which is a little strange to me given the available option of creating a custom link to any url, external or otherwise.

If you don't see this option, you can enable it in the upper right-hand corner by expanding **Screen Options** and enabling *'Link Target'*

Now you should be able to manage individual menu item target behavior.
