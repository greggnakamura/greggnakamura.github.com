I've been a full time remote employee since mid 2010 and, I love it, but, it has been a bit of an up and down roller coaster ride.

The initial thrill of it ended pretty early for me as I found the overall challenges tougher than I would have ever imagined. For one, the comfort of being able to walk over to another developer to discuss a problem was gone. I couldn't visually see who was busy and who was not, leaving me with no sense of the environment. Most importantly, I was now missing out on the spontaneous discussions of code, work, and office life in general.

As for my office, when your home becomes 'it', perspectives change to say the least. You begin to think about what you can and can't do in your own house.

- Don't leave your machine for more than 2 minutes because someone might need you
- Check mail regularly...even though I have notifications enabled
- Check chat regularly...even though I have notifications enabled
- Radio OFF!
- TV OFF!!
- ELIMINATE ALL DISTRACTIONS!!!

I realize the items above are my own unique use case, but I think you get the gist. Remote work changes your comfort zone, and in a lot of ways, makes your job even harder.

Working ~3,000 miles from my main office (Massachusetts) makes it difficult to 'pop-in' from time to time, so I've made some adjustments for work and my clients.

- I'm available during East Coast hours
- I'm online via Skype and participate is chats as best as I can
- Use video to humanize myself
- Actively reach out to my PMs on a regular basis
- Attend all applicable office and client meetings

After some trial and error, this approach seems to be the best way to give myself an 'office' presence. Those in the office, and my client's, don't have to work around my schedule and I can be counted basically at all times when needed.

But what about my developer team? I can't just swing my chair around and participate anymore. Thankfully, as a group, we all participate in chat groups via Skype. Skype isn't really the best tool but does allow for chat, call, and screenshare communications. 

I do regularly contact and meet with my developer colleagues, but it's just not quite the same with the distance barrier. So, over the years, I've looked to other resources to bridge this gap.

- **Twitter**: I pretty much follow anyone that plays a part in influencing me as a developer and use my *Favorites* as a 'bookmark' for resources. I've gained tons of knowledge using this. 
- **MeetUps**: Gives me a chance to physically talk to other Developers and get a much different perpective on what we do in general. I find it quite valuable.
- **PluralSight**: There are many sites out there to keep you up to date on current technologies, but over the years, I've used this repeatedly.
- **Former Colleagues**: An invaluable network of knowledge. Keep them close. Their experiences, past and present, are gold.
- **YouTube**: I can't always make it to a conference or speak, but most of the time you can find videos of them posted on YouTube, such as JSConf.

All in all, I still enjoy working remotely. I do feel like I have to work even harder than I did when I was an in-house developer though. Maybe that's just me, but its a good challenge and one that I will continue to look forward to.
